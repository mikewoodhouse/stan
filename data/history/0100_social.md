# THE SOCIAL SCENE

## THE EARLY YEARS

Before a Social Officer was appointed in 1967, social events were arranged on an ad hoc basis by the Secretary. Mainly, these were coach trips to out-of-town matches. Popular for many years, support for these trips declined as more players became car-owners.

The last such trip was to Caversham in May 1970.

In 1958, Stanley Oxley led a Battersea cricket team against a BBC XI as part of the Battersea Park centenary celebrations. Several other Trinity players appeared and both teams wore the dress of 100 years earlier.

Between 1958 and 1960, Trinity put out a football team against St Mary's FC, winning one match and drawing two.

A six-a-side football competition at Cottenham Park in 1976 saw a Vic Howe-led Trinity side fail to reach the semi-finals.

## AN ELECTED SOCIAL OFFICER

Derek Redwood was elected the first Social Officer in 1967, whereupon a more formal programme of events started in the close season.

Until 1973, a Christmas party was held for members' children, with a variety of Santas in attendance.

Other events included darts nights, snooker evenings a bonfire night, restaurant visits, discos, golf days, a trip to Boulogne, and a cuddly toy.

In recent times, the position of a social officer has become an ad hoc role, reflecting the change in the social environment within society in general.

## DARTS

The Darts championship was formally introduced in 1978. The first winner of the trophy was Vic Howe.
This competition was a regular fixture in the Trinity calendar and continued for over two decades until 2001.

## GOLF DAY

For more than a decade Rick Worthington has organised a golf day each year, usually in September.
