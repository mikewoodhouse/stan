# COMPETITIVE CRICKET

## LEAGUE CRICKET

At the 1978 AGM, a debate took place over where Trinity should seek to participate in some form of organised league competition. The feeling at the time proved to be overwhelmingly against the idea.
Since that time, the feeling has remained that league cricket is widely available to anyone who wishes to play it, but that the Trinity approach is an alternative for those who prefer to play in a more friendly (though still highly competitive) environment.

Nowadays of course, with the heightened profile of the limited overs cricket and the emergence of the 20/20 format, has meant Trinity has found itself playing such games on a more regular basis. Although it must be said that time games are still desired by the majority of the playing membership to ensure the possibility of three results and make for a more enjoyable match.

## LIMITED OVER EVENING COMPETITION

The Decca Cup, organised by the Surrey Cricket Association, was entered by Trinity in 1981. In 1982 it was renamed the Warwick-Wright Cup, and from 1983 the Surrey Cup.

The competition format was 15 eight-ball overs per side, bowlers being restricted to a maximum of four overs each. First-round matches were played in area leagues of four or five, the top two going through to the subsequent rounds.

Trinity entered the competition on six occasions, although the last year, 1986, they were unable to raise a team and withdrew.

Of fifteen matches played, Trinity won only one, never progressing to the second round.

## INDOOR CRICKET

Since 1995, a side has represented Trinity in the six-a-side indoor competition held at the Ken Barrington Centre at The Oval in November and December.

In both 1996 and 1997 the side have reached the finals day, but on both occasions have failed to progress.
Since then, Trinity have forged a partnership with Malden Wanderers, and continue to play in the Surrey Indoor League, under the name Trinity (Oxley) Wanderers.
