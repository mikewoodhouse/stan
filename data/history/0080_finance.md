# FINANCE

In 1949, when the Club was formed, the three founder members paid £3 each into the coffers to pay for pitch hire and purchase of equipment.

For the major part of the Club's history, fundraising, to supplement membership and match fees, has been an important feature.

The committee aims to generate a small surplus each year, in order to build funds with the hope of one day being able to provide members with a Trinity-owned playing facility.

## MATCH FEES

In 1949 the annual subscription was two guineas (£2.10). In 1953 this was changed to 2/6d (12½p) per game and in 1957 an annual subscription of 5s (25p) was added. Between 1958 and 1968, match fees were assessed according to the amount each player had to pay in fares to get to each game. The flat-rate 2/6d match fee was reintroduced in 1968.

Match fees rocketed by 2½p in 1971, and the annual subscription soared to £1. Inflation in the 1970s and 1980s saw fees increased steadily: £2 and 20p in 1975, £3 and 30p in 1977 and £5 and 50p in 1983.

By 1988 the fees had reached £15 and £1, and today, in 1998, annual subs are £45 and match fees £5 (although this now includes the cost of tea).

To bring the above into context, between 1963 and 1988 pitch costs at Cottenham for a full season had increased from £24 to £434. Ten years later, the current schedule of around 30 pitches at Kingshall costs the Club in excess of £2,000 per year.

Trinity cricket is still relatively cheap. For example, in 1994, members at Sidcup paid over £100 annually, with an £8 match fee. And teas were extra. Fourteen years on, despite inflation and the credit crunch, Trinity still beats this rate! Those in work pay £80 for the season, while students pay £25. Players who pay their membership fees get preference when teams are selected for fixtures.

## ANNUAL DRAW

For many years Trinity relied upon the Annual Draw for additional income. The draw was based on The Grand National (1954-62), The Derby (1963-68) and Wimbledon (1963-73).

## SURREY DRAW

Most county cricket clubs run draws through associated member clubs which raise funds for county and club alike. Trinity have been associated with two such fundraisers, firstly Northamptonshire and from 1978, Surrey. Until 1985, when the selling club retained 60% of the ticket sales, the Surrey Draw was the main source of income for Trinity. After the percentage dropped to 50%, it became slightly harder to sell tickets to members. In 2003 the club withdrew from the Surrey Draw.

## GENERATION GAMES RUN FORECAST

Until his death in 1985, Alan Sharpe organised a sweepstake on the number of runs scored during the day at the Generation Games at the end of each season. This was later revived by Alan's son, David and continued until the most recent event in 2001 at Langley Park.

## RAFFLES

One or two raffles have typically been held each year, normally on the "club days", the Single/Double Wicket and Generation Games.

## FANTASY CRICKET

From 199, Mike Woodhouse ran a “Fantasy Cricket” competition, based on the performances of Trinity members. It continued until the end of the 2002 season.

## FRIENDS OF TRINITY

The Friends of Trinity is a financial supporters club, formed in 1981 to help ensure the Club's financial future.

Friends of Trinity's constitution states its objective as follows:"To raise finds by any method approved by the committee of the Friends of Trinity. All funds so raised may only be donated by that committee … in support of the Club in purchasing or leasing a ground for the purpose of playing cricket and associated activities."

The principal fundraising efforts have been though the two clubs, one of 100 shares, costing £1 per month, the other or 50 £5 shares. Each club holds a draw every month, with various cash prizes. The top prizes in the Christmas draws are £500 and £100 for the 50 and 100 clubs respectively.

Over the 18 years of these clubs, approximately £20,000 has been raised.

The Friends of Trinity now assist the Club in the funding of playing facilities each year, which makes the relatively low annual subscription and match fee charged possible.

The Friends of Trinity funds are held partly in an interests-bearing account and partly in Premium Bonds, which, without ever having produced the "big one" have on average matched the typical building society return.
