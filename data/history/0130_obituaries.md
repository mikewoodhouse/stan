# OBITUARIES

## STANLEY OXLEY

Stanley Oxley's contribution to the history of Trinity is unparalleled. He was one of the "trinity" who joined forces to found the club in 1948 and served as Secretary for the first thirty years. When he decided to "retire" in 1979, it was only to take up the more senior role of Chairman, as which he served for a further twelve years until his death at the end of 1991.

In all, between 1949 and 1985, he played in 34 seasons for Trinity, making 834 appearances: over 100 more than any other player. He kept wicket in 309 of those matches, taking 155 catches and 65 stumpings. When not behind the stumps he added a further 118 catches.

He was elected Captain for the 1971 season, and captained Trinity on 183 occasions during his playing career. He captained the side at least once in no fewer than 28 seasons.

Stanley scored a total of 7,580 runs, his highest score of 71 not out coming on August 12, 1967 against Utilex. He was top of the batting averages in 1951. In all, he scored 13 half-centuries in his 782 innings, for a career batting average of 11.54.

Once his playing days were behind him, Stanley continued to be present at most games. In total, he umpired throughout a complete match on 188 occasions, another record which will probably never be beaten. Astonishingly, he also scored 156 complete games, a number only exceeded by his wife, current Club President, Eileen.

Stanley maintained extensive statistics on all aspects of Trinity (Battersea) Cricket Club. He compiled the end-of-season averages as well as the periodic compendia of which this is the latest.
The Club's name was changed in 1994 to Trinity (Oxley) Cricket Club. It was the greatest honour the membership could think of to commemorate his unique contribution.

## ELLIOTT SIMMONDS

Elliott Simmonds played 116 games for Trinity between 1955 and 1969. He died peacefully in his sleep in September 1996.

He scored a total 457 runs at an average of 5.44, his highest score being 21. As a bowler, he took 27 wickets at a cost of 400 runs for an average of 14.81. He took 26 catches (4 whilst keeping wicket) and 3 stumpings.

The Elliott Simmonds Cup, which he donated in 1961, has been awarded ever since by the club captains for "endeavour on the cricket field throughout the season".

After the office of President was created in 1961, Elliott was elected to this position within the Club in 1962; he served in this capacity until 1974 and continued as a Vice-President until his death.

Elliott's greatest contributions to the club were probably off the field: his generosity and commitment were much valued by all who knew him.

## BILL SOLLIS

From 1949 to 1986, Bill Sollis accumulated 428 appearances for Trinity. He was vice-captain in the club's second and third seasons before taking on the job of Captain in 1952, a post he held until 1960. In all, he captained Trinity on 190 occasions, a total only exceeded by two other players.

Bill was the first Trinity bowler to take 1,000 wickets for the Club, and only one other player has achieved this feat. In total he claimed 1,048 wickets for 10,129 runs at an average of 9.67. Only Robert Worthy has sent down more balls for Trinity. His best bowling return was 9 for 13 against Swan Green on May 14, 1953. He took five or more wickets in an innings on 67 occasions. He topped the bowling averages on 7 occasions, finishing runner-up on a further 5.

He was a capable batsman as well, scoring 2,519 runs at an average of 10.16, with two half-centuries.

He also took 168 catches, all in the field, the fourth highest total to date.

After standing down as Captain, Bill was elected Chairman for the following season, 1961, and continued in that role until 1971. He was President from 1975 to 1978, and continued as a Vice-President until his death in January 1998.
