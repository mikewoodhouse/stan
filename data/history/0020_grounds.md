# HOME GROUNDS

After decades of stability, the Club has led something of a vagabond existence since leaving Cottenham Park just before the publication of the 50 Year Book. At that time, it was thought that another long-term residency was beginning—things turned out rather differently.

## MOTSPUR PARK

Trinity's home fixtures were played at the Battersea Borough Council sports ground, Motspur Park from 1949 to 1963. Sunday games were still played at Motspur Park until 1966.

## COTTENHAM PARK

In addition to the full Sunday schedule, some Saturday fixtures had been played between 1953 and 1959. Following amalgamation with Garrick House in 1963, when a full Saturday fixture list was arranged, these games were played at Cottenham Park, near Raynes Park station in Merton.
From 1966 onwards, all Trinity games were played at Cottenham Park. Merton Council built a new pavilion at the ground which was first available to cricketers in 1973. A bar was added in 1974. Cottenham Park Sports & Social Club was the body created by the various sports clubs using the pavilion to administer the bar.

Apart from 1983, when part of the Cottenham square was relaid and Saturday games were played at Raynes Park sports ground, the Club continued at Cottenham until 1996.
As the 1990s dawned, and Government policy forced local councils to reduce the level of upkeep on sports grounds, the facilities at Cottenham, and in particular the pitch, started to decline and the Trinity committee redoubled their efforts, started in 1984, to find an alternative home ground.

## JOSEPH HOOD

When the Trinity Triads (later 'A' eleven, now Sunday Golds) team was created with the joining of the Club with "The Triads", two Sunday teams necessitated a second ground (Cottenham Park being shared with Wimbledon United). The Sir Joseph Hood Recreation Ground in Motspur Park was used between 1989 and 1994 for these matches.

## KINGSHALL

In 1993, two home matches were played at Kingshall Road,  Beckenham. The ground was originally Sedgwick Insurance's company sports ground (Beckenham is home to many such facilities) and later operated independently as Cyphers, noted particularly for cricket, bowls and tennis. (The cricket side is still in existence, now known as Catford Cyphers, and the bowling club is still on the site, although now independent).

Now privately owned, the ground had been renamed Kingshall Country Club (after Kingshall Road, which runs around the perimeter of the front pitch) and the owner was renting pitches on an ad hoc basis.
After the two games in 1993, the decision was taken to move the majority of home matches to Kingshall, the committee feeling that the facilities, and most importantly the pitch, offered more promise than the deteriorating Cottenham Park.

Despite huge investment from Trinity in terms of time and finances the relationship with the owner was never brilliant. With ground hire prices ever-increasing, the pitch becoming dangerous and teas famously degenerating, the club though it best to move on. Today in 2009, Kinsghall is a derelict site: the once-magnificent building burned down some years ago and has been demolished, while the pitch, once so picturesque, is overgrown and uncared-for. The tragedy is that the Club had seen Kingshall as a long-term involvement.

## LANGLEY PARK

From the beginning of 1999, Trinity moved to Langley Park Sports And Social club, a short walk from Eden Park station. Unfortunately the move was short-lived, lasting only two seasons. Although the ground was geographically perfect and playing conditions a great improvement upon Kingshall, the management company, who rented the ground from Transport for London were unable to sustain the ground in the face of a substantial rent increase and it was closed at the end of the 2001 season.

## BBC MOTSPUR PARK

The club’s search for a permanent home continued and in 2002 we moved to the BBC ground at Motspur Park…and at the end of the 2003 season we left. In 2007, a new owner having failed in previous attempts to develop a new fitness and leisure facility, proposals were made to turn the 21-acre site into a graveyard.

## TIFFIN SCHOOL

Another season, another ground, this time it was Tiffin School who played host to Trinity at the start of the 2004 season. It would be the only season we’d spend there as it became clear that, while entirely acceptable for cricketing purposes, the Hampton Court ground was too far away for the majority of the playing membership.

## SANDERSTEAD REC & COOMBE LODGE

Trinity’s membership by this time, while geographically dispersed, was probably centred somewhat to the East of Croydon, a legacy of the Beckenham and Eden Park years. From 2005, therefore, the committee thought it best to move closer to “home”. Croydon council’s pitches in Croydon at Sanderstead and Coombe Lodge were the hoped-for solution both geographically and financially. Local to the playing membership and to the majority of the opposition, the grounds fitted the bill. Alas though, the pitches were maintained badly and the showers worked sporadically at best. Everyone agreed that a solution had to be sought…

## SYDENHAM SPORTS GROUND

…and the solution came in the form of Sydenham Sports Ground. Thanks largely to the efforts of Clive Edghill Trinity made the switch to the picturesque (for some definitions  of “picturesque”) home ground of Sydenham CC. As they are a league side, the majority of  home matches are played on a Sunday with away fixtures on Saturdays. There’s been a great reception for our new home (with several new members joining as a result) and we hope to stay here for the foreseeable future. Fingers crossed it doesn’t burn down…
So as the 60 Year Book is written, the situation is much as it was a decade previously, albeit with a base about a mile removed from that time.
