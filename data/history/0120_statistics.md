# STATISTICAL COMPENDIA

Comprehensive Club averages and statistics have been produced every years throughout the 60 seasons played to date.

Cumulative statistics were compiled after 5, 10, 21, 25, 30, 40 and 50 years.

All but the first two compilations have been printed and bound editions and all except the 30-year book, which was produced by Alan Sharpe, were compiled and edited by Stanley Oxley.  The 50-year book, was produced by Mike Woodhouse to coincide with the 50th Anniversary Dinner/Dance and thus covered only the first 49 seasons. For that publication all averages published during the Club’s history were input into a computer database; it has been updated each year since then and the most recent tables form the second half of this book.

Looking through the statistics in this book, the swing from ball to bat over the years is apparent. Modern bowlers figure but rarely in the higher reaches of the bowling averages (only Dave Moore is in the top ten), while modern batsman are everywhere in the batting equivalent: seven of the top ten could still reasonably be expected to add to their Trinity totals in the 1998 season. Another illustration of the swing towards the bat is that 12 of the 30 partnerships for the 1st to 10th wickets listed in this book were set in the last ten years.

Why should this be? There are probably two reasons, one a palpable Good Thing, the other rather less so. The two are related to a certain extent.

It is probable that the general standard of pitches has improved over the last 50 years. While Cove's pitch, where the track is almost invariably a batsman's paradise is probably the best pitch seen in recent years, the incidence of slow, low pitches, or those with variable bounce has declined. With local authorities having invested smaller and smaller amounts in sporting facilities, however, this may be changing. Trinity is fortunate to have a degree of input into the preparation and maintenance of the pitch at Kingshall, which is now generally one of the better ones we play upon.

The other side of the increasing ascendancy of bat over ball is the lack of cricket in schools. This leads to less young players learning to bowl properly. While any individual with a reasonable eye for a ball can swing a bat and, with a degree of good fortune, score 15 or 20 runs, taking wickets involves, to a large extent, placing the ball in the vicinity of the stumps. This is a skill not quickly learnt.

Unless (or more hopefully until) cricket regains its rightful place in the general sporting curriculum within our schools, it will fall upon the clubs to redress the balance.

The 50-year book has been produced for publication at the 50-year Dinner and Dance, at the start of the 50th season. It therefore summarises only the history and statistics from the first 49 seasons of Trinity.

Stanley Oxley kept his records in a series of beautifully-maintained ledgers. In the computer age, however, the effort of maintaining these ledgers appeared enormous, given the tremendous manual effort required to calculate the hundreds of statistics contained within.

## THE 60-YEAR BOOK

The Club History in this volume has drawn extensively from the 30-, 40- and 50-year books for the record of events occurring before the authors’ personal involvement with Trinity began.

The records have therefore largely been transferred to a computer database, from which many of the tables can be calculated automatically.

Details of 499 players and 2,011 individual performances (one per player per season) had to be extracted from the end-of-season averages, as well as 672 partnerships and 259 individual bowling performances. Each season's averages took about 90 minutes to input: about 75 hours' work in all. In addition, the scorebooks were trawled for additional information, particularly about the early years, when the averages contained less than full set of information now recorded. The whole production took about 3 months from start to finish.

For the technically-minded, the principal software used has been: Microsoft Access (97, 2000 and 2007) for the data and Microsoft Word for the preparation of the text.
