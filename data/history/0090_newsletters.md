# NEWSLETTERS

In 1982 the committee suggested that members might welcome an occasional newsletter. Steve Ripsher was persuaded to edit and produce the publication, and Trinity News was first published in November that year.

## THE BEAMER

The newsletter was re-christened in 1983, after Mike Simmons' suggestion won a "Name the Newsletter" competition. Issue 4 appeared in May 1983. It was the last to be produced as Steve Ripsher moved away and no-one was prepared to step into the breach.

At the 1983 AGM, president Charles Moulder said of The Beamer, "it was a great idea, an enjoyable read and the most exciting thing that had happened to Trinity for ten years."

In 1995, Paul Oakes revived the idea of a newsletter. The title was taken from the pavilion clock at Kingshall, which had been frozen at the same time for as long as anyone could remember!

## THE MAROON AND GOLD (MAG)

After Paul moved on to pastures Scouse, Mike Woodhouse started the Maroon & Gold in 1995 and it ran for 18 issues until 1999. And after a eight year hiatus, it returned in 2007, under the editorship of Matthew Kiernan producing three issues a year to positive feedback. Hopes are that the MAG will continue to be published on a regular basis for many years to come.
