# MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS

## GARRICK HOUSE CC

Before Trinity started to play regular Saturday fixtures, several members played for Garrick House CC on Saturdays, with the reverse being true on Sundays. Garrick House was attached to a firm of publishers, but its players decided to sever the connection in 1962. The logical step was amalgamation with Trinity. This was approved at an extraordinary general meeting on November 12, 1962.

## THE TRIADS

In 1988, the 40 Year Book reported "…interesting proposals were put forward in 1988 by Trinity member Phil Hammond, who had been involved in the formation of a club named “The Triads”, which had been created from the remnants of three other teams: The Oaks, Smith Bundy and BIS. He suggested a merger with Trinity so that two teams might play on Sundays. The idea received support in committee, and was due to be put to the 1989 AGM."

The team in question had been formed out of three teams (hence the name), the BIS and Smith Bundy company teams and The Oaks sports club. As well as Phil Hammond, the Morris brothers, Dave and Ron, Mike Hosking, Vince Reid and Bill Burgon had already played for the Club in 1988.

In the event, the Triads club merged with Trinity at the 1989 AGM and were elected as playing members at that meeting. The "Trinity Triads" team would be an additional eleven, playing on Sundays.

The Triads XI was renamed the Sunday 'A' XI after one season, and became the Sunday Golds (the other Sunday side being christened the Maroons) in 1996. The Golds continued to play until 2000, when the club began to field one Sunday team a weekend due to a drop in membership.

Of the 15 or so new "Triads" members who joined in 1989, many went on to contribute greatly to Trinity both on and off the field. In particular, Dave Morris, Dave Thatcher and Les Miller have served as captain and vice-captain, Vince Reid and Ron Morris have both been Social Officer. Mike Woodhouse and Mike Bowers are the two remaining Triads, who both still contribute massively to the club.
