# CLUB TOURS

Trinity has undertaken a tour over the last weekend in May (traditionally the weekend of Whitsun - now renamed Spring Bank Holiday) for 34 of its 50 years. Although cricket is the focus of the three or four days, the social aspect is of tremendous importance, with a number of "traditions" having grown up over the years.

## THE NEW FOREST

From 1951 to 1960 (except 1955) a three-day tour over the Whitsun weekend was arranged. The tour party was based at Lyndhurst and the three games were all played in the New Forest area around Lyndhurst.
After 1960, no tour was arranged until 1971.

## THREE COUNTIES
The "Three Counties" tour, taking in Oxfordshire, Hampshire and Berkshire, ran for the ten years between 1971 and 1980. Based at the Queens Hotel in Newbury, this tour was scheduled for four days (to include the Tuesday after Whit Monday).

This series of tours introduced the Tour Dinner, which has been a regular feature of all tours since.
A two-year hiatus followed, after which the current tour schedule commenced.

## HAMPSHIRE AND WILTSHIRE

In 1983 the tour moved to the Hampshire/Wiltshire border, based at Fordingbridge. The following year, the George Hotel in Amesbury was adopted as headquarters, as it has remained to the present date.

The 15 tours to this area which have taken place to date have had various oppositions for the Saturday games, but Woodgreen (Sunday), Steeple Langford (Monday) and Cove (Tuesday) have been constant fixtures throughout. Several Saturday tour fixtures against Frensham raise hopes that the whole four days would become a settled schedule but the vagaries of the Hampshire League fixture system put paid to that. While less attractive geographically, Churchleigh has at least been an attractive location to kick off the tour in recent years, prohibitively overgrown outfield and all.

There have been many notable events during Trinity tours, most, sadly now lost in the mists of alcohol. One that happened in recent years and is still recalled fondly by those present is the year when Cove, unable to move a County Under-17s game, were forced to take us to an alternate ground in order to fulfil the fixture. Imagine the consternation of those assembled when they saw that they were to be playing at the Army Ground in Aldershot. Not only were the Lord’s-appropriate changing rooms a shock but for most it was their first encounter with an electronic, remote-controlled scoreboard and for Captain Tony Springer, what may well have been a unique experience: being asked at the end of the first innings whether he would prefer the light or heavy roller!

1997 saw the introduction of a "fines" system during the Tour. Fines are awarded for behaviour both on and off the field. Such fines involve the consumption of dubious alcoholic beverages and pickled eggs (the latter withheld from any member showing too obvious enjoyment!) were levied on a particularly vindictive, not to say random basis. Depending on personnel, availability of suitably noxious substances and willingness of one or more individuals to serve as Fines Committee members, the practice continues on a semi-regular basis. Tour “virgins” should consider themselves warned…
