# In the beginning

Trinity (Battersea) Cricket Club was formed when three men, who played for St Mary's CC on Saturdays, decided to start a club in order to play on Sundays. This decision was taken in 1948, by John Keyte, George Scott and Stanley Oxley. After several meetings, the name “Trinity” was adopted, for no other reason than that there were three people involved. “(Battersea)” was appended a few months later when, upon joining the Club Cricket Conference in 1949, it was discovered that another club of the same name was already affiliated.

## Stanley Oxley

…served as Secretary for 30 years and as Chairman for a further 13 years. He played his last game in 1985. He was Captain in 1971. The Club was renamed in 1993 as a tribute to his unique contribution, following his death in 1991. His wife, Eileen, supported the Club in a number of invaluable capacities, including a spell as President.

## George Scott

…played until 1959. He served as captain for the first three seasons of the Club's existence, as Chairman for 12 years, and later as President. He was elected a Life Member in 1962. He passed away in 2006.

## John Keyte
…moved away from London in 1960, which forced his retirement from playing for the Club. He served as Treasurer for the Club's first four years, and served on the Committee for a further seven. He died in 1980.

# What’s in a name?

In the months that followed the amalgamation with Garrick House CC, a great deal of discussion occurred over the Club name, and whether it should be changed. Suggestions included “Temperance XI”, “Surrey Stumpers”, “Union”, “Ichabod”, “Shaftesbury”, and “Cottenham Park”. Probably unsurprisingly, none of these inspired the general membership and the original name continued without change.
The club did eventually change its name at the 1993 AGM. Mrs Eileen Oxley (Club President since 1995) had been asked to decide on an appropriate tribute to Stanley. Her suggestion was that the Club rename itself to “Trinity (Oxley) Cricket Club”. The membership agreed that this was fitting recognition of a unique contribution to Trinity, and the name change was approved unanimously.

# Colours and badge

At the first Annual General Meeting, held on February 9, 1949 with ten members in attendance, old gold and maroon were adopted as the Club's colours.
The colours have remained the same for all of the club's 60 years. The badge, on the other hand, has changed a number of times, most recently to reflect the club's 60 years of existence.
