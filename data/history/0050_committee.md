# COMMITTEE

Around 250 Trinity committee meetings have been held. In the first fifty years of the Club’s history, all but four of were held at Stanley and Eileen Oxley's homes - first in Battersea Church Road, and then at Ashbury Road, Battersea.

Since then, the committee has been rather more peripatetic, meeting at various members’ houses and even from time to time over breakfast at Addington Golf Club when a quorum has been engaged in an early-morning round.

Geoff Cooper is the longest-serving member of the current committee, having served first as Captain in 1977 and Treasurer since 1982. After Geoff, current Chair Jon Leadley is the second longest serving member having also served as captain, social secretary and secretary, even finding time to take the odd year or two off in the process.
