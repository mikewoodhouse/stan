### Worksheets (typical)

#### Matches

Top row summarises results, all automatic.

Row 5 for about 30 rows (2022: rows 5 to 32) are match details, after which there as some usful summary calculations. In the event of more macth rows being needed, I suggest inserting them before the last current match row so that the summary formulae will include the added matches without needing the referenced arrays to be adjusted (there are ways to mitigate this but as the author and expected sole user I didn't bother, assuming I'd be aware of any potential pitfalls here...)

Each row represents a match where at least one ball was bowled - if there was no play at all then the match isn't be considered for, e.g. appearances, even if everyone actually turned up!

##### Individual match rows

Start from the date (column B - the day of week is calculated and is mostly a hangover from the days of Saturday/Sunday/midweek games). Then fill in each column as far as X (opposition leg-byes).

Possible values for `Result` are W, L, D, T, ND (where the match did not reach a conclusion, usually because of rain).

The `notes` columns (J and N) are free txt, for anything considered noteworthy. Purely subjective. Not used for anything at present but may be presented in the "Stan" website if it ever gets finished.

`Queries` (column AE) has been used on occasion where I needed to go back to someone who was at the match to get more information, usually because something was missing or unclear in the book.

Columns AF to AH were added to record the numbers of runouts (and for Trinity players, the identities of the dismissed batsmen) in order to make summarising that information in the "Notes" section at the end of the averages easier to compile.
